AddroText - a simple text editor

The goal of this project was just to exercise by creating a simple text editor capable of working with .txt files. Features:

- open/save/save as .txt files
- works with both ANSI and Unicode
- user can choose font to view documents in (per application, not per file, just as Notepad)
- window remembers size, location and font upon close and opens with those.
- if windows was minimized when it was closed, program starts with default values.
- it barks
